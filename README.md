# What is our project?

Try to escape a haunted house!

It was a cold October night and you and your friends decided to enter the haunted house you have heard rumors about for years. It is at the end of Grave Road, a long dead end street with poor lighting. Each time you drive past you are convinced you here the sounds of bats and the ghost who lives in house 13. There is allegedly gold in the house, but no one has found it yet. Some people enter and never escape.

You now have the choice of whether to join them.

To play the game andnavigate the haunted house with the goal of escaping after finding gold, type "Go" with an option that follows (EX: GO basement, GO garden) Be sure to include the hyphen if the location has two words.
